Please see :class:`~gpsea.analysis.predicate.genotype.VariantPredicates` 
and :class:`~gpsea.analysis.predicate.genotype.ProteinPredicates` 
for a list of the predicates available off the shelf.

However, feel free to open an issue on our `GitHub tracker <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/gpsea/issues>`_
if a predicate seems to be missing.
