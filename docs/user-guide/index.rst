User guide
==========

The user guide is the primary reference for all GPSEA functionality
and it aims to connect all the information you need to build
your own G/P association analysis workflows.

A typical workflow starts with ingest, Q/C, and exploration of the cohort data.
Then, one or more G/P hypotheses need to be conceived and expressed as GPSEA analysis.
The analysis includes ways for partitioning the cohort along the genotype and phenotype axes,
as well as the statistical test and multiple-testing correction.

The guide is broken into short self-contained sections
that each discuss a single step of a G/P association workflow.
The sections include code examples and we encourage the users to run the examples
in an interactive Python environment.
