The concept of phenotype denote the observable attributes of an individual, but in 
medical contexts, the word "phenotype" is used to refer to some deviation from normal morphology, physiology, or behavior 
(c.f. `Deep phenotyping for precision medicine <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22504886/>`_).
A key question in biology and human genetics concerns the relationships between phenotypic abnormalities and genotype.
In Mendelian genetics, the focus is generally placed on the study of whether specific disease-causing alleles
are associated with specific phenotypic manifestations of the disease. 

GPSEA (Genotypes and Phenotypes - Statistical Evaluation of Associations, pronounced /dʒiːpiːsiː/)
is a Python package designed to support genotype-phenotype association analysis.
The input to GPSEA is a collection of `Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Phenopackets <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35705716/>`_.
GPSEA ingests the phenopackets and analyzes the genotype-phenotype associations.
The genotype can include variant types (e.g., missense vs. premature termination codon),
or variant location in protein motifs or other features.
Phenotype can be represented by `Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) <https://hpo.jax.org/app/>`_ terms, but using other phenotypes is possible.
Statistical analysis is performed using e.g `Fisher Exact Test <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test>`_.

GPSEA integrates with modern interactive computing environments, such as Jupyter notebook.
Therefore, we recommend to install GPSEA into a Jupyter kernel and to perform the analyses
in a Jupyter notebooks.
The documentation is structured such that each section can be executed in a notebook,
and we encourage running the examples while reading the documentation.

The documentation includes :ref:`setup` instructions,
a :ref:`tutorial` with an end-to-end example, and a comprehensive :ref:`user-guide`.
The technical information is available in API reference.
