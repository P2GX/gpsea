Tutorial
========

Here we demonstrate an end-to-end genotype-phenotype analysis with GPSEA.
The tutorial illustrates just one of the many ways GPSEA can be used to characterize genotype-phenotype correlations.
The :ref:`user-guide` contains details about additional methods and functionalities.


The tutorial presents an analysis of a cohort of individuals with pathogenic variants in *TBX5* leading to 
`Holt-Oram syndrome MIM:142900 <https://omim.org/entry/142900>`_. 

Holt-Oram syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by 
upper limb defects, congenital heart defects, and arrhythmias (`PMID:38336121 <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38336121/>`_).
It has been observed in the literature that congenital defects of the ventricular and atrial septum are more
common in the truncating than in the missense variants (`PMID:30552424 <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30552424/>`_).
Additionally, upper limb defects are more frequent in patients with protein-truncating variants (`PMID:38336121 <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38336121/>`_).

To perform the analysis, we curated the literature and created on `GA4GH phenopacket <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35705716/>`_ for each 
affected individual. The phenopackets are made available in `Phenopacket Store <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/phenopacket-store>`_.



The analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the analysis, the `MANE <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/MANE/>`_ transcript 
(i.e., the "main" biomedically relevant transcript of a gene) should be chosen unless
there is a specific reason not to (which should occur rarely if at all). 

In the case of *TBX5* the MANE transcript is `NM_181486.4`. Note that the trascript identifier (`NM_181486`) and the version (`4`) are both required.
A good way to find the MANE transcript is to search on the gene symbol (e.g., *TBX5*) in `ClinVar <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/>`_ and to
choose a variant that is specifically located in the gene. The MANE transcript will be displayed here (e.g., `NM_181486.4(TBX5):c.1221C>G (p.Tyr407Ter)
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/495227/>`_).

We additionally need the corresponding protein identifier.
A good way to find this is to search on the transcript id in `NCBI Nucleotide <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/>`_.
In our case, search on `NM_181486.4` will bring us to `this page <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_181486.4>`_.
If we search within this page for `"NP_"`, this will bring us to the
corresponding protein accession `NP_852259.1`.

>>> cohort_name = 'TBX5'
>>> tx_id = 'NM_181486.4'
>>> px_id = 'NP_852259.1'


Load HPO
^^^^^^^^

GPSEA needs HPO to do the analysis. 
We use HPO toolkit to load HPO version `v2023-10-09`:

>>> import hpotk
>>> ontology_store = hpotk.configure_ontology_store()
>>> hpo = ontology_store.load_minimal_hpo(release='v2023-10-09')

.. tip::

  Use the latest HPO release by omitting the `release` option.

Prepare cohort
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we will load the samples to analyze. We will use the cohort of 156 individuals with mutations in *TBX5*
whose clinical signs and symptoms were encoded into HPO terms
and stored in `Phenopacket Store <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/phenopacket-store>`_.

>>> from ppktstore.registry import configure_phenopacket_registry
>>> phenopacket_registry = configure_phenopacket_registry()
>>> with phenopacket_registry.open_phenopacket_store('0.1.18') as ps:
...     phenopackets = tuple(ps.iter_cohort_phenopackets(cohort_name))
>>> len(phenopackets)
156

We loaded 156 phenopackets which need further preprocessing to prepare for the analysis.
We will compute functional annotations for the mutations and then include the individuals into 
a :class:`~genophenocorr.model.Cohort`:

>>> from genophenocorr.preprocessing import configure_caching_cohort_creator, load_phenopackets
>>> cohort_creator = configure_caching_cohort_creator(hpo)
>>> cohort, validation = load_phenopackets(  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
...     phenopackets=phenopackets, 
...     cohort_creator=cohort_creator,
... )
Patients Created: ...

and we will check that there are no Q/C issues:

>>> validation.summarize()  # doctest: +SKIP
Validated under none policy
No errors or warnings were found

We loaded the patient data into a `cohort` which is ready for the next steps.

.. seealso::

  Here we show how to create a :class:`~genophenocorr.model.Cohort` from phenopackets. 
  See :ref:`input-data` section to learn how to create a cohort from another inputs.


Explore cohort
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can now explore the cohort to see how many patients are included.

>>> from genophenocorr.view import CohortViewable
>>> viewer = CohortViewable(hpo)
>>> report = viewer.process(cohort=cohort, transcript_id=tx_id)
>>> with open('docs/report/tbx5_cohort_info.html', 'w') as fh:  # doctest: +SKIP
...     _ = fh.write(report)

.. raw:: html
  :file: report/tbx5_cohort_info.html
  
.. note::

  The report can also be displayed directly in a Jupyter notebook by running::

    from IPython.display import HTML, display
    display(HTML(report))

Now we can show the distribution of variants with respect to the encoded protein.
We first obtain `tx_coordinates` (:class:`~genophenocorr.model.TranscriptCoordinates`)
and `protein_meta` (:class:`~genophenocorr.model.ProteinMetadata`) 
with information about the transcript and protein "anatomy":

>>> from genophenocorr.model.genome import GRCh38
>>> from genophenocorr.preprocessing import configure_protein_metadata_service, VVMultiCoordinateService
>>> txc_service = VVMultiCoordinateService(genome_build=GRCh38)
>>> pms = configure_protein_metadata_service()
>>> tx_coordinates = txc_service.fetch(tx_id) 
>>> protein_meta = pms.annotate(px_id)

and we follow with plotting the diagram of the mutations on the protein:

>>> from genophenocorr.view import ProteinVisualizer
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 8))
>>> visualizer = ProteinVisualizer()
>>> visualizer.draw_protein_diagram(
...     tx_coordinates,
...     protein_meta,
...     cohort,
...     ax=ax,
... )
>>> fig.tight_layout()
>>> fig.savefig('docs/img/tutorial/tbx5_protein_diagram.png')  # doctest: +SKIP

Prepare genotype and phenotype predicates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will create a predicate to bin patients into group
depending on presence of a missense and frameshift variant to test 
if there is a difference between frameshift and non-frameshift variants
in the individuals of the *TBX5* cohort.

>>> from genophenocorr.model import VariantEffect
>>> from genophenocorr.analysis.predicate.genotype import VariantPredicates, groups_predicate
>>> gt_predicate = groups_predicate(
...     predicates=(
...         VariantPredicates.variant_effect(VariantEffect.MISSENSE_VARIANT, tx_id),
...         VariantPredicates.variant_effect(VariantEffect.FRAMESHIFT_VARIANT, tx_id)
...     ),
...     group_names=('Missense', 'Frameshift'),
... )
>>> gt_predicate.get_question()
'Genotype group: Missense, Frameshift'

.. note::

  There are many other ways to set up a predicate for testing 
  for a GP correlation.
  See the :ref:`predicates` section to learn more about building
  a predicate of interest.


By default, GPSEA will perform one hypothesis test for each HPO term used to annotate more than one individual in the cohort.
This also includes the terms implied by the ontology "true path rule", 
which states that presence of a term 
(e.g., `Ventricular septal defect <https://hpo.jax.org/browse/term/HP:0001629>`_)
implies presence of all its ancestor terms 
(e.g., `Abnormal ventricular septum morphology <https://hpo.jax.org/browse/term/HP:0010438>`_, 
`Abnormal cardiac septum morphology <https://hpo.jax.org/browse/term/HP:0001671>`_,
`Abnormal cardiac ventricle morphology <https://hpo.jax.org/browse/term/HP:0001713>`_, ...).
However, testing multiple hypothesis increases the chance of receiving false positive result,
and multiple testing correction must be applied.
See :ref:`mtc` for information about how to perform multiple testing correction with GPSEA. 

For general use, we recommend using a combination
of a *Phenotype MTC filter* (:class:`~genophenocorr.analysis.PhenotypeMtcFilter`) with a *multiple testing correction*.
Phenotype MTC filter chooses the HPO terms to test according to several heuristics, which 
reduce the multiple testing burden and focus the analysis
on the most interesting terms (see :ref:`HPO MTC filter <hpo-mtc-filter-strategy>` for more info).
Then the multiple testing correction, such as Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg,
is used to control the family-wise error rate or the false discovery rate.

Here we use HPO MTC filter (:meth:`~genophenocorr.analysis.CohortAnalysisConfiguration.hpo_mtc_strategy`)
along with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (:meth:`~genophenocorr.analysis.CohortAnalysisConfiguration.pval_correction`):

>>> from genophenocorr.analysis import configure_cohort_analysis, CohortAnalysisConfiguration
>>> config = CohortAnalysisConfiguration()
>>> config.hpo_mtc_strategy()
>>> config.pval_correction = 'fdr_bh'
>>> analysis = configure_cohort_analysis(
...     cohort=cohort,
...     hpo=hpo,
...     config=config,
... )

Now we can perform the analysis and investigate the results.

>>> result = analysis.compare_genotype_vs_cohort_phenotypes(gt_predicate)
>>> result.total_tests
16

We only tested 16 HPO terms. This is despite the individuals being collectively annotated with
259 direct and indirect HPO terms

>>> from genophenocorr.analysis import prepare_hpo_terms_of_interest
>>> terms = prepare_hpo_terms_of_interest(hpo, cohort.all_patients, min_n_of_patients_with_term=2)
>>> len(terms)
259

We can show the reasoning behind *not* testing 243 (`259 - 16`) HPO terms
by exploring the phenotype MTC filtering report.

>>> from genophenocorr.view import MtcStatsViewer
>>> mtc_viewer = MtcStatsViewer() 
>>> mtc_report = mtc_viewer.process(result.mtc_filter_report)
>>> with open('docs/report/tbx5_mtc_report.html', 'w') as fh:  # doctest: +SKIP
...     _ = fh.write(mtc_report)

.. raw:: html
  :file: report/tbx5_mtc_report.html

..
  
  TODO: 
  Show how to write out the tested HPO terms.

and these are the HPO terms ordered by the p value corrected with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure:

>>> from genophenocorr.analysis.predicate import PatientCategories
>>> summary_df = result.summarize(hpo, PatientCategories.YES)
>>> summary_df.to_csv('docs/report/tbx5_frameshift_vs_missense.csv')  # doctest: +SKIP

.. csv-table:: *TBX5* frameshift vs missense
   :file: report/tbx5_frameshift_vs_missense.csv
   :header-rows: 2

We see that several HPO terms are significantly associated
with presence of a frameshift variant in *TBX5*.
For example, `Ventricular septal defect <https://hpo.jax.org/browse/term/HP:0001629>`_
was observed in 31/60 (52%) patients with a missense variant 
but it was observed in 19/19 (100%) patients with a frameshift variant.
Fisher exact test computed a p value of `~0.0000562` 
and the p value corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg procedure 
is `~0.00112`.
