GPSEA allows users to perform many different kinds of genotype-phenotype correlation (GPCs) analysis. See the :ref:`tutorial` for an introduction.
In general, the analysis will include steps for data input, exploration of the cohort to assist in generating hypotheses about potential GPCs to test, 
corresponding choice of genotype and phenotype predicates to perform the test, choice of statistical test, and approach to multiple-testing correction (mtc).
The pages shown in the table of contents provide more information about each step.
