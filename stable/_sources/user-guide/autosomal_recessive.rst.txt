Genotype-Phenotype Correlations in Autosomal Recessive Diseases
===============================================================

In autosomal dominant diseases, the analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations is comparatively simple because
each affected individual carries only one disease-associated allele. While it would in principle be possible to
restrict analysis to homozygotes (who carry two identical copies of the disease-associated allele, one each on the maternal and paternal chromosome),
in practice compound heterozygotes are common and it is desirable to perform other comparisons.

For instance, one might compare the three groups missense/missense (homozygotes) against missense/nonse (compound heterozygotes)
 and nonsense/nonsense (homozygotes) (see for example `Li JT et al. (2022) <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36303223/>` for an example with 
 the *SUOX* gene).



GPSEA implements a 6-field Fisher Exact Test to support this kind of analysis.
