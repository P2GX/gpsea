Genotype classifiers
####################


A genotype classifier assigns an individual into a class based on their genotype.
In GPSEA, genotype classifiers leverage information from one of the four areas:

* Sex
* Disease diagnosis
* Presence of variant(s) that meet certain inclusion criteria (e.g. a missense variant in heterozygous genotype)
* User-provided codes

Classification based on sex or disease diagnosis is relatively straightforward - the individuals
are assigned by the biological sex or presence of a specific diagnosis.
See :ref:`group-by-sex` and :ref:`group-by-diagnosis` for more details.

Partitioning based on variants is, however, much more flexible,
to support the analysis of the broad spectrum of pathomechanisms
that have been shown to lead to genetic diseases.
In general, we first create one or more variant predicates to select the variants of interest (:ref:`variant-predicates`),
then count and interpret the number of alleles in the cohort members,
including factors such as the expected mode of inheritance and sex,
to assign the tested individual into a genotype group
(:ref:`variant-category` or :ref:`allele-count`).

The ultimate flexibility in the genotype class assignment can be achieved using genotype codes,
which essentially delegate the assignment to the user (:ref:`genotype-codes`).
